| Day 1
    - Run R in terminal using "source('filename.r')"
    - c(): concatenated character vector function
    - A <- matrix(1:x, nrow= rows, ncol = cols, byrow = )
    - Factors: categorical variables (low, inter, high)
    - list()
    - Data frames: DS that contain vectors and factors (same len)
    - Indexing works like Python with the exception of logical indices
        - Logical indeices returns a logical vector
        - weight[weight > 60]
    - order(): Sorting function 
    - aggregate()
    
| Day 2
    - Copulas 
        - Probability distrbution vs pdfs vs cdfs vs multivariate distrbution vs marginal distrbution
        - Lebesgue-Stieltjes integral: Integrating prob. distrs. 
            - Different way of writing the integral for the expected value E[x]
        - Copula: A function that joins a multivariate distribution functions to its 1-D margins
        - Used to describe the dependence between random variables 
        - Parameters to copula function -> probability distrbutions 
        - An n-copula is an n-variate distrbution function on [0,1]^n with univariate margins
            uniformly distributed in [0,1]
        - Proving a function is a copula 
            - Find a suitable probablistic model whose distrbution functions concentrated
                on [0,1]^n and has uniform marginals 
        - Allow for study of the structure of stochastic dependency in a scale free manner,
            independent of the specific marginal distrbution, i.e. seperation of dependency 
            structure from the specific marginals 
        - If all univariate margins are continuous, then the copula is unique
